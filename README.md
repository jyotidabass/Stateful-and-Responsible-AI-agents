# Stateful-and-Responsible-AI-agents

Stateful AI agents are computer programs that remember information about previous interactions with users or the environment. This information is used to inform the agent's behavior and decision-making in subsequent interactions.
For example, a customer service chatbot is a stateful AI agent. When you interact with the chatbot, it remembers the details of your conversation, such as your name and the issue you're facing. This information helps the chatbot provide personalized responses and solutions tailored to your specific needs.



Responsible AI agents are computer programs that are designed and developed with ethical considerations in mind. These agents are intended to minimize negative consequences and maximize positive outcomes for humans and society.
This means that responsible AI agents are created with a focus on transparency, fairness, privacy, accountability, and non-discrimination. For example, a responsible AI agent may be programmed to avoid biased decision-making or to respect user privacy by not collecting unnecessary personal information.
